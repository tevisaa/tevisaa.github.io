*I am a geoscientist working on problems related to the co-evolution of life and the environment and climate feedbacks.*

I work in Dr. Akshay Mehra's Reconstruction Lab in the <a href='https://www.ess.uw.edu/'>Department of Earth and Space Sciences</a> and Dr. Mari Winkler's <a href='https://winklerlab.com/'>research group</a> in the <a href='https://www.ce.washington.edu/'>Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> as a post-baccalaureate student at the University of Washington.

Previously, I worked as a research associate at <a href="https://rarecyte.com/">RareCyte, Inc.</a> on problems related to spatial biology and immuno-oncology and as a lab assistant in the molecular oncology department at <a href="https://cellnetix.com/">CellNetix Pathology & Laboratories, LLC.</a> Before transitioning into biomedical research, I studied music performance at <a href="https://college.berklee.edu/">Berklee College of Music</a>, where I was awarded a full-tuition, merit-based scholarship. While pursuing my education in music, I studied and performed with MacArthur Fellow and Pulitzer Prize recipient Tyshawn Sorey, MacArthur Fellow Vijay Iyer, and MacArthur Fellow Jason Moran, amongst others.

My research interests center around the fields of biogeochemistry and geobiology. I am seeking doctoral opportunities in one of these two fields, with the ultimate goal of improving our fundamental understanding of Earth systems so as to build more equitable futures.
