## *Stromatolite morphogenesis*

  <p style="font-size: 0.85em; font-style: italic;">Drone map of stromatolitic reef system from the 1.9 Ga Pethei Group in Northwest Territories, Canada. Orange lines are measured transects and blue dots are sampling locations. Window views display micro- and macro-scale morphologies. Textural metrics for photomicrographs and variance across bedding plane are reported.</p>

I am interested in answering questions about the relationship between stromatolite morphology and environmental and/or biological conditions, with the goal of creating process-oriented understandings of these enigmatic features that dominate Earth's biological history. Currently, I am working on improving our ability to use stromatolites as quantitative indicators of paleoenvironment and/or paleobiology. To that end, I am developing novel methods to quantitatively describe stromatolite shape and form, which I then use to make interpretations about the process of morphogenesis. Some of the techniques that I use include: three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions generated using structure from motion (SfM), image processing and quantitative textural analysis, and geospatial and geometric analysis.

## *Climate feedbacks in wetland ecosystems*

In the Winkler Lab, I study how wetland environmental microbial communities respond to climate perturbations. More specifically, my goal is to constrain the potential for wetland ecosystems to contribute to climate feedbacks via methanogenesis. To that end, I use batch bottles and continuous-feed bioreactors to culture environmental microbial samples embedded within hydrogels, a porous polymer used as a proxy for soil aggregates. To quantify the biogeochemical response of microbial communities to elevated temperatures, I use gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and spectrophotometric methods to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes.

Before transitioning into geoscience, I worked in the field of biomedicine. At RareCyte, Inc., I designed and optimizated highly multiplexed immunofluorescence staining and imaging methods and developed and validated clinical circulating tumor and rare cell biomarker assays. My goal was to create novel methods for visualizing and quantifying protein expression for tumor biomarkers. I used the following techniques to develop and validate these methods: highly-multiplexed immunofluorescence staining (IF), flow cytometry, antibody-fluorophore conjugation, and spectrophotometry. Before working as a research associate at RareCyte. Inc., I performed molecular characterization of cancer subtypes for diagnosis and treatment compatibility for stage III and IV cancer patients using next-generation sequencing (NGS), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and flow cytometry at CellNetix Pathology and Laboratories, LLC.
